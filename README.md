# Javascript-timed-quiz

A single webpage that generates a quiz that tests the player's JavaScript fundamental knowledge and lets players score their past scores.

## Description

When user clicks on the Start Quiz button, the webpage will start displaying questions and multiple choice answers. The initial time given is 70 seconds for 8 questions in total.
Each time the user answers a question incorrectly, the penalty is that time is reduced by 10 seconds.
The score is the amount of time left after a user answers all questions, after reducing it by the number of incorrect answers x 10s.
If users want to save their score for future reference, they will need to enter their name intial.

Note: Users can check their previous scores by clicking on View Highscores on the top left handcorner, but can only do this before and after the quiz, not during the quiz.
